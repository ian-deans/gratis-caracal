echo "Short Description of echo:
echo -- write arguments to the standard output

Long Description:
The echo utility writes any specified operands, separated by single blank (\` \') characters and followed by a newline
    (\`\n\') character, to the standard output.

    The following option is available:

    -n    Do not print the trailing newline character.  This may also be achieved by appending \`\c\' to the end of the
          string, as is done by iBCS2 compatible systems.  Note that this option as well as the effect of \`\c\' are
          implementation-defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (\`\`POSIX.1\'\') as amended by Cor. 1-2002.  Applications aiming
          for maximum portability are strongly encouraged to use printf(1) to suppress the newline character.

    Some shells may provide a builtin echo command which is similar or identical to this utility.  Most notably, the
    builtin echo in sh(1) does not accept the -n option.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page."


printf "\n\e[36m  Running 'echo -n Hello'\e[39m\n"
echo -n "hello"
