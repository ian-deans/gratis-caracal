echo "FRom faireſt creatures we deſire increaſe,\n
That thereby beauties Roſe might neuer die,\n
But as the riper ſhould by time deceaſe,\n
His tender heire might beare his memory:\n
But thou contracted to thine owne bright eyes,\n
Feed’ſt thy lights flame with ſelfe ſubſtantiall fewell,\n
Making a famine where aboundance lies,\n
Thy ſelfe thy foe,to thy ſweet ſelfe too cruell:\n
Thou that art now the worlds freſh ornament,\n
And only herauld to the gaudy ſpring,\n
Within thine owne bud burieſt thy content,\n
And tender chorle makſt waſt in niggarding:\n
   Pitty the world,or elſe this glutton be,\n
   To eate the worlds due,by the graue and thee." > sonnet_1_complete.txt
